## Introduction

In this post, we will use Python to model a single good market. We will use the demand and supply functions to find the equilibrium price and quantity. We will also calculate the consumer and producer surplus.


### Demand and Supply

```python{.python .cell-code}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.optimize import fsolve
```
